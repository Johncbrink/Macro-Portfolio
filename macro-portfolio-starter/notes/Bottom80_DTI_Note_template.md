# Distributional Leverage: Bottom‑80% DTI (United States)
**Author:** John Brinkmeyer  
**Repo:** <your GitHub link>  
**Date:** YYYY‑MM‑DD

## Executive Summary
- Bottom‑80% DTI (latest): **[value]**. Versus [period]: **[higher/lower] by [x]**.
- Takeaway: **[one sentence on consumer leverage/fragility]**.

## Why This Metric
Aggregate ratios hide distributional stress; the Bottom‑80% drives consumption.

## Method (short)
- Debt_0–80 = liabilities 0–50 + (30/40) * liabilities 50–90  
- Income_0–80 = sum of CEX after‑tax incomes (0–20…60–80)  
- Quarterly end‑of‑period resample; DTI = Debt_0–80 / Income_0–80

## Results & Cycle Context
- Level: **[value]** (latest). Trend: **[rising/falling]** since **[year]**.  
- Peak/Trough: **[value/year]** / **[value/year]**.

## Interpretation
- Consumer risk: **[e.g., debt service sensitivity, credit tightness]**  
- Policy lens: **[e.g., easing/tightening implications]**  
- Market lens: **[e.g., retail spending, delinquencies]**

## Limitations & Next
- 0–80 derived proportionally from 50–90.  
- Next: deflate with CPI; add debt service; compare to delinquencies.
